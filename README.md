# Rock Paper Scissors Game!
A fun little game that will a player can play against a computer. The player can win if they can select the correct guess!

# How it's played
The game is played in rounds. Each round the player will select either "Rock", "Paper", or "Scissors". The computer will be randomly selecting these as well at the same time. The player and computer will not know what their opponent has selected until the conclusion of the round. When the player and the computer have selected their guess, conclude 
the round by determining the round winner. First to 5 round wins is the winner of Rock Paper Scissors!

# Determine the round winner
- Rock beats Scissors
- Paper beats Rock
- Scissors beats Paper

If the same guess is selected (example: Rock and Rock) then their is no winner of the round.

# Example of play
Player selects Rock and computer selects Scissors. The round concludes with the reveal of both guessing leaving the player with a win for that round. Congrats!
