# Rock Paper Scissors Game!
A fun little game that a player can play against a computer. The player can win if they can select the correct guess!

# How it's played
The game is played in rounds. Each round the player will input either "Rock", "Paper", or "Scissors". The computer will be randomly inputting these as well at the same time. The player and computer will not know what their opponent has inputted until the conclusion of the round. When the player and the computer have inputted their guess, conclude the round by determining the round winner. First to 5 round wins is the winner of Rock Paper Scissors!

# Determine the round winner
- Rock beats Scissors
- Paper beats Rock
- Scissors beats Paper

If the same guess is inputted (example: Rock and Rock) then their is no winner of the round.

# Example of play
Player inputs Rock and computer inputs Scissors. The round concludes with the reveal of both guessing leaving the player with a win for that round. Congrats!
